And so, we know that we have two identifiers for the snippet, let's discuss them in more detail 🧐 . 

The first symbol "🅹"  is intended for sorting snippets by the first letter of the name of the technology for which these snippets were written, and in this case, it is "JavaScript" 📜 .

The second symbol "🆆" from the first row "qwer" is a key symbol on the keyboard that denotes a certain type of data, in this case, a string 📝 , since the first row "qwer" corresponds to simple data types.

As a result, we get "🅹🆆" which calls all the methods of the string object in a modal window, and this subchapter will talk about how we will sort these methods 💼 .
