## 

Welcome to the key base approach. This approach is based on the layout of the keys on the keyboard, namely qwer, asdf, and <yxc, and divides all operations of JavaScript methods into set, get, add, del, check, and filter. How does this approach work? We can take a look at the example below.

#### 1. Keyboard

*<em> - Clone project to your local machine: </em>*

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gk-daniel/js-snippets.git
```  

*<em> - Navigate to the project directory using the cd command: </em>*

```bash
cd js-snippets
```
